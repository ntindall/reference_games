<h2><center>Matching Game</center>  </h2>

	<p> 

    In this experiment you will play a fun matching game with another turker! Both of you are going to be given a set of tangram pictures which will look like this. 
</p>
    <p>
      <center><img src="images/tangramBoard.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:600px;height:200px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
    You'll each have the same 12 images but the order they are in will be different. As a team, your goal is make your boards match. 

</p>

<p>

    One of you will be assigned the Director role and the other will be the Matcher. The goal here is for the matcher to move their images to the positions they are in on the director's board. The challenge is that neither of you can see each other's boards. So for the matcher to move their images to match the director's board, you'll both need to communicate. This is why you're given a chatbox where you can send messages back and forth to each other about where to move the images. 

</p>

    <p>
      <center><img src="images/chatBox.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:700px;height:400px"></center>
    </p>

<p>
    When you and your teammate think you have matched all the images you can, the matcher should click on the Submit Round button in the upper left hand corner. PLEASE DO NOT PRESS THIS BEFORE YOU ARE DONE WITH THE ROUND. 

</p>
    <p>
      <center><img src="images/button_example.png" alt="initial matcher's board" style="width:600px;height:75px"></center>
    </p>

<p>
    
  You won't get feedback on how many images you have correct while you are playing the round, but after each round ends you will be told your score from the previous round. 
</p>

<p>
  If this task isn't fun enough already (which we think it is) you and your teammate will individually be rewarded 1 cent for every correctly matching images you finish a round with. This means you and your partner each have the chance to earn up to 12 BONUS CENTS per round for each of the 6 rounds. 
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned above, there are a total of 6 rounds. At the start of each round, you and your teammates images  will be shuffled again. After the sixth round you will fill out a quick 15 second survey and be on your way. 
</p>

<p> Two final notes: Since you are playing with another turker, you may see this screen before the game begins. 
      <p>
      <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="initial matcher's board" style="width:700px;height:150px"></center>
    </p>

Just hold tight. Another turker should join the game within the next few minutes; if you're still waiting after 15 minutes have passed, your HIT will automatically submit and you will be compensated the full amount for your time.
</p>

<p> Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once you start the game (including the waiting page). If you refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in and you and your partner may not be able to submit the HIT. Thank you! 
</p>
